# TumorExtraction
A MATLAB code to identify and extract tumors from MRI images.

A brain tumor is an abnormal growth that occurs inside the brain or the skull and is one of the most dangerous types of diseases that can have fatal consequences. 
Therefore, since these tumors occur in many individuals worldwide, their study is of great importance. One of the methods for diagnosing brain tumors is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

In this project, we focus on investigating and comparing three methods for extracting brain tumors and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. 
By obtaining the tumor region, further processing such as calculating the area and center of the tumor can be performed on this region.
